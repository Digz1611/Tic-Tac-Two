Obi-Wan arrives on Mustafar and confronts Anakin, who is standing near a lava river. Anakin turns to face him, anger and conflict evident in his eyes.

Obi-Wan: Anakin, the Chancellor is evil. You must come with me now.

Anakin: I don't want to hear any more of your lies, Obi-Wan. The Jedi have betrayed me. I will never return to their ranks.

Obi-Wan: Chancellor Palpatine is manipulating you, Anakin. You're blinded by your anger and fear.

Anakin: No, I see clearly now. The Jedi are the ones who are wrong. They have held me back for too long.

Obi-Wan: You're on a path to destruction, Anakin. Please, don't do this. It's not too late to turn back.

Anakin: It is too late, Obi-Wan. My allegiance is to the Chancellor and to the Dark Side!

Obi-Wan: (saddened) You were the Chosen One, Anakin! You were supposed to bring balance to the Force, not leave it in darkness.

Anakin: I will bring balance, by destroying the Jedi and the Sith. I will rule the galaxy!

Obi-Wan: (resigned) If you won't listen to reason, then you're my enemy, Anakin.

Anakin ignites his lightsaber, and Obi-Wan does the same. They engage in a fierce lightsaber duel, leaping and clashing on the unstable terrain of the lava river.

Obi-Wan: (as they fight) I have failed you, Anakin. I have failed you.

Anakin: (angrily) I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over!

Obi-Wan: (defending) Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil!

Anakin gains the high ground, and Obi-Wan warns him not to try to jump. Anakin ignores the warning and tries to leap over Obi-Wan, who swiftly strikes him down. Anakin's legs and remaining arm are severed, and he tumbles down the embankment, landing near the lava river, where he catches fire.

Obi-Wan approaches the burning Anakin, filled with sorrow and regret.

Obi-Wan: You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you.

Anakin: (writhing in pain) I hate you!

Obi-Wan: (quietly) You were the chosen one. It was said that you would destroy the Sith, not join them. Bring balance to the Force, not leave it in darkness.

Obi-Wan turns and walks away, leaving Anakin to his fate as he burns on the banks of the lava river. The scene fades to black.
